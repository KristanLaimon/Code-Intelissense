# CodeSense

![CodeSense Logo](./.github/imgs/code_sense_logo.png)

**CodeSense** brings live IntelliSense-like functionality to your Obsidian code blocks — offering syntax highlighting, contextual suggestions, and semantic validation for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Dataview inline or fenced blocks.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Live Suggestions:** Context-aware completions as you type (like IntelliSense).
- 🎨 **Syntax Highlighting:** Real-time coloring of JS, TS, and Dataview expressions.
- 🧠 **Semantic Checking:** Detect undeclared variables, invalid expressions, and more.
- 🧩 **Dataview Support:** Smart completions and highlighting within Dataview blocks.
- ⚡ **Zero-lag UI:** Efficient DOM placement with auto-adjusted popup positioning.
- 📦 **Non-intrusive:** No need to switch editors — everything works inline in Obsidian.
